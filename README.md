# ULCPanel-FullCommunity
## Universal Linux Control Panel


An open-source project for Linux distributions. This is the FULLCOMMUNITY version.

When installed, use this:


`chmod +x directory placed in/*.sh`

and   

`chmod +x directory placed in/scripts/*.*`   
  
To ensure all the files work. The only things that should be in *`/scripts`* are shell files, so no need to worry.
  
  
Obviously, this is for any distribution of Linux, and is made to be versatile.
Solve your problems yourself by improving the FullCommunity version of ULCPanel!
