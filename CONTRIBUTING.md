# Contributing to the Universal Linux Control Panel project

To begin, thank you for wanting to contribute to our project!

This short guideline ... guide will just describe the reccomended guidelines for creating new scripts for ULCPanel. These are
not rules, just reccomendations. If you follow these, it will be more likely to be added to our project. If this guideline guide
seems incomplete, feel free to make a Pull Request to make changes.


## What do I need to know about this project?

ULCPanel is a program designed to be Open-Source and simple. We don't want to remake the scripts we have designed, so
take a look around the `/scripts` folder to see what we have so you can make something we *don't* have.

We are planning to have multiple projects and containing folders centered around different "topics," so keep that in mind.


## How do I contribute?

Well, glad you asked!

Anyone can contribute to this version, since it's fully community-made!


Just, please. Don't get carried away. Just make it better, not worse. 
This isn't a playground, it's a community-made super project.


## Also, make sure to:

* Be descriptive

* Follow the community guidelines

* Not republish code from different repositories or projects without granted permission

* Be creative

* Help make the project better!


Thank you for wanting to contribute to our project!
